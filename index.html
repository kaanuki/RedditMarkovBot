        <h1>Reddit Markov Bot</h1>
        <p>A bot that, whenever your post MarkovME on reddit, responds with a random sampling of your comments using a Markov Chain.</p>

        <p>A Markov Chain for Reddit Comments</p>

<p>To run your own instance of this, just do "pip install -r requirements.txt" and then run "python markovReddit.py". This runs on Python 2.7. </p>

<p>Also, ignore all the random notes I wrote to myself while I code. Though, if you'd like to implement any of my TODO's, I'd be
delighted. </p>

<p>To use on reddit, just type in MarkovME for a generation of past comments, and MarkovME: freqCount for an analysis of your most used words.</p>

<p>Better formatted TODOs:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I want this bot to have threads. Specifically, I want it to have a separate instance for each group of subreddits. Now, praw supports this with praw-multiprocess. I'm working on making the bot run in several different processes. It's easy because it doesn't share state.</p></li>
<li><p>I want a database, eventually, so I can start collecting info on users. </p></li>
<li><p>I need to handle exceptions less jenkily.</p></li>
<li><p>I want to eventually add a feature that'll tell you the user that's most similar to you (Jaccard similarity between subscribed subreddits). This will take an incredible amount of data gathering, so it's a long term goal.</p></li>
<li><p>The whole thing right now feels kind of jenky and unreliable. I don't feel confident that if I left it to run in the morning, it wouldn't crash in an hour. That's a multitutde of issues that I'll work on. </p></li>
</ol>
