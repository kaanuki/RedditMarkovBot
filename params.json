{"name":"Reddit Markov Bot","tagline":"A bot that, whenever your post MarkovME on reddit, responds with a random sampling of your comments using a Markov Chain.","body":"A Markov Chain for Reddit Comments\r\n\r\nTo run your own instance of this, just do \"pip install -r requirements.txt\" and then run \"python markovReddit.py\". This runs on Python 2.7. \r\n\r\nAlso, ignore all the random notes I wrote to myself while I code. Though, if you'd like to implement any of my TODO's, I'd be\r\ndelighted. \r\n\r\nTo use on reddit, just type in MarkovME for a generation of past comments, and MarkovME: freqCount for an analysis of your most used words.\r\n\r\nBetter formatted TODOs:\r\n\r\n1. I want this bot to have threads. Specifically, I want it to have a separate instance for each group of subreddits. Now, praw supports this with praw-multiprocess. I'm working on making the bot run in several different processes. It's easy because it doesn't share state.\r\n \r\n2. I want a database, eventually, so I can start collecting info on users. \r\n \r\n3. I need to handle exceptions less jenkily.\r\n \r\n4. I want to eventually add a feature that'll tell you the user that's most similar to you (Jaccard similarity between subscribed subreddits). This will take an incredible amount of data gathering, so it's a long term goal.\r\n\r\n5. The whole thing right now feels kind of jenky and unreliable. I don't feel confident that if I left it to run in the morning, it wouldn't crash in an hour. That's a multitutde of issues that I'll work on. \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
